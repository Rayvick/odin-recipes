        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cans refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 cups peeled, cored, and chopped apples</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <h3> Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a bundt pan with butter or non-stick spray.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the granulated sugar and ground cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut each biscuit into quarters. Dip each piece into the melted butter, then roll it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Set aside on a plate.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, combine the chopped apples, brown sugar, ground nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Mix well to coat the apples evenly.</li>
            <li>Layer the coated biscuit pieces and apple mixture in the greased bundt pan, starting and ending with the biscuit pieces. Make sure to distribute the apples evenly throughout.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the monkey bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
