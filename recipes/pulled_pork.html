        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This smoked pulled pork is tender, juicy, and full of deep, smoky flavor. The pork shoulder is first soaked in a cider brine, which adds subtle sweetness and helps lock in moisture. After brining, it’s coated in a rich brown sugar BBQ rub that forms a flavorful crust as it slowly smokes. The result is perfectly seasoned, fall-apart pork that’s delicious on its own or piled high on sandwiches.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork shoulder is perfect for pulled pork because it’s inexpensive, forgiving to work with, and tends to have a lot of marbling (which means it’ll result in tender meat). An 8-pound pork shoulder roast should make about 20 servings.</li>
            <li>Apple cider: A straightforward cider brine infuses the pork with rich flavor, ensuring it stays tender and juicy</li>
            <li>Sugar: Use a blend of white and brown sugars for the rub</li>
            <li>Seasonings: The sweet and savory rub is flavored with kosher salt, paprika, onion powder, ground black pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Hickory chips: You’ll need three cups of soaked hickory chips for your smoker.</li>
            <li>Onion: An onion gives the pork even more bold flavor as it smokes</li>
        <h3> Directions</h3>

            <li>Brine the pork shoulder.</li>
