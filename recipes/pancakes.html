        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This smoked pulled pork is tender, juicy, and full of deep, smoky flavor. The pork shoulder is first soaked in a cider brine, which adds subtle sweetness and helps lock in moisture. After brining, it’s coated in a rich brown sugar BBQ rub that forms a flavorful crust as it slowly smokes. The result is perfectly seasoned, fall-apart pork that’s delicious on its own or piled high on sandwiches.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
            <li>Sugar Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
            <li>Leaveners Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
            <li>Salt: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt — the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
            <li>Buttermilk: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
            <li>Milk: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
            <li>Butter: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
        <h3> Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl</li>
            <li> Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            <li>Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
            <li>Add toppings</li>
        </ol>
        </ul>
